# Eat-da-Boyga! (The Sequel)

Eat-da-Boyga is a rather useless app created to demonstrate MVC and **Sequelize** ORM design with deployment to Heroku using a SQL database via JawsDB.

## Functionality

Add a burger by typing in the provided text box and clicking the Make Boyga button. Burgers that have yet to be eaten are shown on the left, and burgers that have been eaten are shown on the right. By entering a customer name and clicking the Nom Nom! button next to the burgers on the left will virtually eat the burger and add it to the right side (along with the name of the customer who at it).

Heroku Deployment:  https://quiet-atoll-95913.herokuapp.com/
